Hi there! This is Yunpeng Zhao (赵云鹏 in Chinese). I got my bachelor's degree in Aircraft Control and Information Engineering at Beihang University (BUAA) this June and going to a gap year to deepen my research. I have decided to pursue further studies at the doctorate level upon successful completion of my undergraduate studies, and <font color="red">I am looking for an available Ph.D., M.Phil, or RA position!</font>

During my undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Bo Liu](http://www.sa.buaa.edu.cn/info/1014/4787.htm) on machine learning for medical image analysis and graph neural networks. My research interests lie in Medical Image Analysis, AI for Health and Computer Vision currently and I am open to explore other topics.
